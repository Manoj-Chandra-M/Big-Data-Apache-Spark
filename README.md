# Big-Data-Apache-Spark
A situation can arise when a company is growing from a startup to a bigger organization and we now want to migrate the Python code we developed and ran on our laptops with small datasets to a big data/cloud architecture in Databricks.
To implement this scenario, a project is carried out where data and features are migrated from laptop based python queries to cloud based pyspark queries.
